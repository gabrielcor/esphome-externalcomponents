# ESPHome External Components
Different external components to test and use funcionality

This project is using [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/).

## Components 
-   [x] empty_binaryx: just an empty binary sensor to try out the waters. Start here if you just want to create your first external component.
-   [x] pulse_meter_new: a copy of the pulse_meter component just to understand that you can use an existing external component and extend it (even if it is just changing its name)
-   [x] ticket_dispenser: allows ticket detection for a ticket dispenser like the one sold at https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005004289633949.html
